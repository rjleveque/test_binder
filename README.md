To test Dockerfiles on binder

Paste the URL of this repository into https://mybinder.org/

Or simply click this link: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/https%3A%2F%2Fhub.gke.mybinder.org%2Fuser%2Frjleveque-test_binder-pv6fynh5%2Ftree%2Ftest_binder/master)

Once binder starts, it should show a Jupyter notebook interface.  Click on `test_binder` and then open `Index.ipynb` for further instructions.

Clawpack should be installed, and this Index notebook lets you confirm this.
